# 1. Creation of List
# ======================
# Creating a List
List = []
print("Blank List: ")
print(List)

# Creating a List of numbers
List = [10, 20, 14]
print("\nList of numbers: ")
print(List)

# Creating a List of strings and accessing
# using index
List = ["Geeks", "For", "Geeks"]
print("\nList Items: ")
print(List[0])

# Creating a Multi-Dimensional List
# (By Nesting a list inside a List)

# Creating a List with
# the use of Numbers
# (Having duplicate values)

# mixed type of values
# (Having numbers and strings)

# Creating a List

# Python program to demonstrate
# Addition of elements in a List

# Creating a List

# 2. Addition of Elements
# in the List
# ============================
List.append(1)
List.append(2)
List.append(4)
print("\nList after Addition of Three elements: ")
print(List)

# Adding elements to the List
# using Iterator
for i in range(1, 4):

# Adding Tuples to the List

# Addition of List to a List
List2 = ['For', 'Geeks']

# Addition of Element at
# specific Position
# (using Insert Method)

# Creating a List
List = [1, 2, 3, 4]

# Addition of multiple elements
# to the List at the end
# (using Extend Method)
List.extend([8, 'Geeks', 'Always'])

print(List)

# Creating a Multi-Dimensional List
# (By Nesting a list inside a List)
List = [['Geeks', 'For'], ['Geeks']]

# accessing an element from the
# Multi-Dimensional List using
# index number
print("Acessing a element from a Multi-Dimensional list")
print(List[0][1])
print(List[1][0])

# !!! Exercise !!!
# you will need to add numbers and strings to the correct lists using the "append" list method.
# You must add the numbers 1,2, and 3 to the "numbers" list, and the words 'hello' and 'world' to the strings variable.
# You will also have to fill in the variable second_name with the second name in the names list, using the brackets operator [].
# Note that the index is zero-based, so if you want to access the second item in the list, its index will be 1.
# =============================================================================================================
numbers = []
strings = []
names = ["John", "Eric", "Jessica"]

# write your code here
second_name = None


# this code should write out the filled arrays and the second name in the names list (Eric).
print(numbers)
print(strings)
print("The second name on the names list is %s" % second_name)
